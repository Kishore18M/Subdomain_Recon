# Subdomain_Recon
Developed an automated Bash-based subdomain enumeration tool that integrates Subfinder, Sublist3r, Amass, and other reconnaissance utilities for efficient discovery.
Optimized recon output by consolidating multi-tool results and removing duplicates, delivering only unique subdomains and reducing manual effort during VAPT and bug bounty engagements.
